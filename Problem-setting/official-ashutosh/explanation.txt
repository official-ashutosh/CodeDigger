The minimum no. of steps to required to do so is (m*n-1);
This can be proved using strong form of induction.
Base case : take n = 1, m = 1 : we required no breaks i.e. ans = 0 = m*n-1.
Inductive case : Let us assume that it is true for all grids less then or equal to (m-1) x (n-1) grid.
So, no. of breaks required to do so are (m-1) x (n-1) â€“ 1.
Now we have to prove this for m x n.
So divide this in 4 grids of form : (m-1) x (n-1) , (m-1) x 1, 1 x (n-1), 1 x 1
So we requied  : (m-1)*(n-1)-1+(n-1)-1+(m-1)-1+3 = m*n -1
